# Preflight Beta - Your GitHub Copilot

Preflight is a browser extension that surfaces quality and security data for every npm-published project.

Preflight makes it fast and simple for you to make decisions about using npm packages. We surface data and a rubric for their quality and security, and if anything merits your attention, we alert you.

You won't need to needlessly read 3rd-party code. You can focus on the stuff that matters, like writing that killer new feature and shipping product, and we'll continuously monitor the hundreds (often thousands) of projects you depend on.

Use us when your code takes flight ðŸ›«

If any of our checks come back with concerning answers we'll notify you through a modified GitHub UI or on your PR, letting you investigate and focus on the stuff that's abnormal.

Welcome! This extension generally augments GitHub and related websites with R2C data. It contains a number of product experiments and isn't stable - we're regularly trying new things, listening to your feedback, and working to provide you value as you code. Please expect it to change regularly ðŸŽ‰

To install the extension, visit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/emaioeinhnifhcmlihcbooknbpjdbllb) or our [Mozilla Add-ons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/r2c-beta/).

If you have questions, feedback, or ideas, please reach out to us at support@ret2.co.
